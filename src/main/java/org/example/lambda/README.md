# Lambda Expressions

Lambda expressions allow you to pass blocks of code as parameters, offering a powerful and flexible way to write cleaner and more functional code with minimal effort.
These compact and expressive constructs can greatly simplify your programming tasks.

Method references build on this concept, providing an even more concise way to refer to existing methods using lambda expression syntax.

For a lambda expression the method is inferred by java.

For a lambda expression to be valid it must adhere to following rules:
- It must have a parameter list
- It must have an arrow token (->)
- It must have a body
- It must have a return type

Java requires types which support lambda expressions to be functional interfaces. 

A functional interface is an interface with a single abstract method.
